# LSTM_Time-series_Classification
This task portrays various LSTM models attempting to classify time-series data 
from Wireless Sensor Network deployed in real-world office environments. 
The task is intended as a real-life benchmark in the area of Ambient Assisted Living. 
This is a binary classification effort which is formed of making predictions
to user movements in real-world office environments in the time-series data-set.
